        # The constructor should store the area or dimensions of the rectangle.
        # However, this code returns the area immediately, which is incorrect.

# Define a class for Circle
class Circle:

# Creating an instance of Rectangle and attempting to print it
# This code is problematic as the __init__ method should not return a value. 
# It is meant to initialize the object state.
print(Rectangle(4, 5))  # This will give an error because Rectangle's constructor returns a value, not an object.
